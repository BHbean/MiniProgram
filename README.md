# MiniProgram
This is a collection for all the MiniProgram I writed before.
1. **Baoyan Star**:
   This a program for collecting infomation about summer camps of many universities and displaying them. Once you have been chosen by some certain schools, the 'scheduler' of this program would dynamically make decisions for you to choose which camps to go according to the time and the importance. (It's a birthday gift for a girl)
2. **Credit Accumulator**:
   It is a tool for calculating scores when playing games like mahjong or poker. It is based on a "room" model where anyone can get in and out, and it can calculate the scores for the present ones accordingly. It is made for the convenience of my friends and myself.
